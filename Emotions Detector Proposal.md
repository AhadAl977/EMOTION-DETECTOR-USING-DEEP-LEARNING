# Emotions Detector Proposal
## Introduction
The tone of someone's voice is half of the message, us as humans we can tell if someone is happy or sad, but the computers don't. 
So, in order to translate this important part of the message, deep-learning algorithms will become in handy.
The core objective of this project is to apply deep-learning algorithms in order to detect the gender and the emotion of the speaker's tone.
## Data Description
The dataset was collected from [RAVDESS](https://zenodo.org/record/1188976) which contains **1441** file inputs from 24 different actors split between male and female, In each actor there are **60** voice recordings of all the emotions. Such as:
- Happy
- Neutral
- Sad
- Angry
- Calm
- Fearful
- Disgust

## Tools

Here the intial tools that will be used in this project: <br/>
Technologies: python, and Jupyter Notebook with python libraries: 
- For EDA
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Numpy
  - Seaborn
- For deep-learning 
  - Speech recognition
  - Librosa
  - Keras
  - Sklearn
  - Tensorflow
  - Scipy

## Conclusion
The way people speak tells a lot about how they feel; we can discern if someone is pleased or sad as humans, but computers face a struggle.
Deep-learning algorithms will be useful in order to translate this critical component of the communication.
The main goal of this project is to use deep-learning algorithms to recognize the speaker's gender and feelings.
